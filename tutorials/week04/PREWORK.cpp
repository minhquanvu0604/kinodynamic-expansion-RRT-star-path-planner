Today's build is upon solutions in week 03 (ex03) 

Work through these questions and make sure you understand what is going on in each example.  If you have any questions about the material please raise them in the next tutorial session.

For Ex01 we use [shapes folder in starter](./starter/shapes)  

Polymorphism - Ex01
------------------

* Modify the base class `Shape` file [shape.h](./starter/shapes/shape.h) such that functions `getArea()` and `checkIntercept()` is defined in `Shape`, and the child classes are required to implement this function. 
  (Polymorphism and the concept of virtual).

* Create a Square, Circle and Triangle, and store them in a vector of `Shape` pointers
* Create a function that loops through shapes and display their area.
