Week 10
=========================

NO specific PREWORK this week, review last weeks class material (messgaes, nodes)

The tutorial (as well as Assignment 3) requires the pfms_support packages to be part of your ROS system. You would have already made pfms_support part of your `catkin_ws` to be able to work on Assignment 1 and 2.
